# Deep-Q-Network-FrozenLake
Frozen Lake environment from OpenAI Gym

This research underscores the environment predictability in shaping efficiency and robustness of learning algorithms. We Frozen Lake environment from OpenAI Gym is ideal for this investigation. In this grid-based board game, the agent navigates its way from start point to end point (reward) on the slippery ice. To see how different environmental uncertainties affects the learning process of Deep Reinforcement Learning agent we have use Deterministic (slippery) and non-deterministic (non-slippery) conditions.
